Man, what? This shit funny, one sec
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

She told me, put my heart in the bag (in the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (don't hurt me, love)
Now I'm runnin' from her love, I'm not fast (fast)
So I'm makin' it worse (I'm makin' it worse)

Now I'm diggin' up a grave for my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (it's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

I can't reverse it, it was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse, you said you loved me first (first)

One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur, and I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is, "Flex on a ho every time you're insecure"
I can't see it through, I'm runnin' from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

She told me, put my heart in the bag (in the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (don't hurt me, love)
Now I'm runnin' from her love, I'm not fast (fast)
So I'm makin' it worse (worse)

Now I'm diggin' up a grave for my past (past)
I'm a whole different person (person)
It's a gift and a curse (curse)
But I cannot reverse it

You gave me the runaround, I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid, I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies when you come around
When you come around, when you come around

You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs, so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer

Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwin' rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave, I ju' wanna be with you
You, you, you

She told me, put my heart in the bag (in the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (don't hurt me, love)
Now I'm runnin' from her love, I'm not fast (fast)
So I'm makin' it worse (I'm makin' it worse)

Now I'm diggin' up a grave for my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (it's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it
