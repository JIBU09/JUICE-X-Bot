Oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm leanin' like I'm using a needle
Probably party by myself because I don't fuck with people
Marijuana with the pills, euphoric, and cerebral
I do it all to chase the thrill (thrill)
I know what I'm doing's illegal
But ain't nothin' else gon' numb my pain like the pills and the reefer
I popped a few, they made me sing like Franklin, Aretha
I think they caught up to my brain (brain)

Oh, tell Perky I need her, without her
I get to sweatin', shakin', and catchin' a fever
I know some people regret takin' the shit that they've been takin'
But, baby, I can't take it, so I guess I need it
I'ma keep it, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah (whoa)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, aw

I'm leanin' like I'm using a needle
Probably party by myself because I don't fuck with people
Marijuana with the pills, euphoric, and cerebral
I do it all to chase the thrill (thrill)
I'm leanin' like I'm using a needle
Probably party by myself because I don't fuck with people
Marijuana with the pills, euphoric and cerebral
I do it all to chase the thrill (thrill)

Oh-whoa (oh, whoa-oh-oh)
Oh-whoa, oh (oh-whoa, oh)
I need to let the past go
But my anxiety's a handful (anxiety's a handful)

When I wake up in the mornin'
I lean over and kiss my baby, she kill my torment
But some of it is inside me, it's hurting and hiding
That's why I get high, so high that no one can find me

I'm leanin' like I'm using a needle
Probably party by myself because I don't fuck with people
Marijuana with the pills, euphoric, and cerebral
I do it all to chase the thrill (thrill)
I know what I'm doing's illegal
But ain't nothin' else gon' numb my pain like the pills and the reefer
I popped a few, they made me sing like Franklin, Aretha
I think they caught up to my brain
