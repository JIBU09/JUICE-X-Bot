You in the way, put a hole in your wig
Desert Eagle on me, bitch, the bullet hole big

Double cup with that red lean, I'ma sip classy
Dior on my feet, I feel classy
You say you love me, do you mean that?

I don't think so, bitch, I know so
Money by the boatload

'Cause I'm a rich guy (rich guy)

Keep the Lamborghini parked at the bank, though (yeah, park)

Buyin' horses like in Salem, know we mob tie, aw, yeah
Rich in real life
