Don't cross me, you don't want smoke, ayy (whoa, whoa, whoa)
If you're crossin' my streets, better look both ways

Uh, got my cash up (got my cash up, cash, cash, cash)
Tell them fuck niggas catch up (tell them fuck boys catch up)
Too bad, they can't catch us (too bad, they can't catch us)
He alone, he need backup (he alone, he alone)

Choppa back him up, he got his back to the wall (choppa back him up)
I just saw you kissin' that bitch, she had her tongue on my balls (kissin' that bitch)
I was into Xanax and Percocets, she love Adderall (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
She was knockin' on my nerves, told that bitch to knock it off (bitch, knock it off)

Ayy, crossin' my streets, both ways (bitch, knock it off)

I ain't gon' lie, fuck me for this Dolce
You could do me for the Dior next Thursday
She sucked me at the front door, that's foreplay
Left my condoms at the crib, but what am I to run for?

I don't even run from niggas, that's what I got a gun for
Too many fuck niggas in the world, that's what I killed your son for
Try to intersect my money, dummy, then you done for
All I care about is money, honey, I don't love whores, ayy

New gun I can't wait to use, bitches, I won't wait for you
Hit him in his brain, now his shit look like baby food
Bitch, I'm not erasin' you, I'm really replacin' you
Bad bitch in my room, there's some things I can't wait to do

Liquor and exotic hoes, I'm tryna live in the moment
In the studio, my phone on silent, ho, I gotta stay focused
Fuck with me, and it get violent, ho, violent, ho
Kill you, then I fuck your bitch, huh, vámonos

Baby, I'm too high, I ain't wanna fuck, no way (I ain't wanna fuck, no)
Bitch, you got some nerve, claimin' that you know me (claimin' that you know me)
