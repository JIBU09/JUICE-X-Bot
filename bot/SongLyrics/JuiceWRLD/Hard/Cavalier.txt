Bitches be mad when they should be embarrassed (Purps on the beat)
Haha, bitches be mad when they should be embarrassed

I need some Actavis, I just spilled Wock' on my wrist
Fucked your bitch, I got lean on her tits
You bought a Challenger, I bought a Lamborghini
It came with windows tinted with the stick shift
I call my gun Actavis
It leave you leanin' like you bought a two liter and poured a ten
My hand on my ratchet, yes, I'm 'bout that action
It's not a pump action, it's a .40 with extended clip

Yeah, Gucci is rare, they stop and stare
I remember pullin' up in the Cavalier
I remember drivin' off that drank, can't steer
Smokin' on loud pack, nigga, I can't hear (yeah)
Louis is rare, they stop and stare
I remember pullin' up in the Cavalier
Can't drive off the drank, no, I can't steer
Smokin' on loud pack, nigga, I can't hear

We on the run, we on the hunt
Keep shittin' on you niggas, I got the runs
Shit so damn much, I need some Tums
Love the way my lil' bitch speak in tongues
Say you not the one and you got a gun
Nigga, you ain't on shit 'til you go blow somethin'
If you really want smoke, let a nigga know somethin'
My gun gay, it'll fuck you, then hit your heo up

Woo, bitch, I'ma do what I want to
My Draco come with a kick (hi-yah)
I taught that bitch Kung-Fu, what you wanna do?
Like, woo, huh, bitch, I'ma do what I want to
Peel that nigga's scalp back
I treat that boy like a moon roof, zoom, zoom
Put a hole in his body, no Froot Loop
Draco make him dance, tutu

They gon' make me blow my fuse
Got these hatin'-ass bitches and niggas confused
I beat up the rap game and I give it a bruise
Give 'em black and blues while I count up the blues
Got my hand on my tool
Pop a couple of blues
Then I pour up a pint 'til I take me a snooze

I need some Actavis, I just spilled Wock' on my wrist
Fucked your bitch, I got lean on her tits
You bought a Challenger, I bought a Lamborghini
It came with windows tinted with the stick shift
I call my gun Actavis
